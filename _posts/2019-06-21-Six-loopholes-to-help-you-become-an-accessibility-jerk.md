Here are six tips to help you become an embarrassment to humanity while keeping your site WCAG compliant.

1. [To add text on a page without color contrast limitations use a disabled element](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G165) like a button. Style it nice and horrible to look like hipster text.
2. [Create logos to create content immune from contrast and color requirements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html#key-terms).
3. Use a very small font. Aren't small fonts the cutest? There's a good chance that antialiasing will render an inadequate contrast. WCAG has your back by stating [contrast testing can be performed with antialiasing turned off](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html#key-terms).
4. Combine a lightweight font family with a font color that provides marginal contrast. This common technique is used by thousands of sites to make things horrible for everyone.
5. Declare all images on a page (that aren't functional) as decorative and add alt="".  
6. [Let user-agent defaults dictate focus appearance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/general/G165). Now take that focus outline color use that for your background. Tr√®s chic!

This article is designed to be a humorous way to bring attention to shady accessibility practices. If you're using loopholes to skate by, don't think people don't notice or care.

You can do better.
